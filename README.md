======================

TODO:
- Fix django test settings. Right now it uses `*` to import settings from base file. Also we need separate settings for production.
- Improve presentation layer. Right now it is minimal. It should be more user friendly with dynamic content loading, loaders indicators, etc.
- Add search and sort functionality to collection set.
